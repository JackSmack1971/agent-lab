# Emergency Response Procedures - Agent Lab

## Incident Response Plan

### Phase 1: Detection & Assessment (0-15 minutes)

#### 1.1 Alert Triage
**Primary Alert Channels:**
- GitHub Actions workflow failures
- Health monitoring alerts (Slack/email)
- User reports via support channels
- Application error logs

**Severity Classification:**
- **Critical (P0)**: Complete service outage, data loss, security breach
- **High (P1)**: Major functionality broken, partial data loss
- **Medium (P2)**: Minor features broken, performance degradation
- **Low (P3)**: Cosmetic issues, minor inconveniences

#### 1.2 Initial Assessment Checklist
- [ ] Confirm incident scope and impact
- [ ] Identify affected systems/components
- [ ] Assess user impact and business consequences
- [ ] Determine if incident requires immediate rollback
- [ ] Notify incident response team

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Acknowledge alert within 5 minutes
2. Create incident ticket in issue tracker
3. Notify on-call engineer via SMS/pager
4. Start incident timeline documentation

### Phase 2: Containment (15-60 minutes)

#### 2.1 Isolation Strategies

**For Code/Deployment Issues:**
```bash
# Immediately disable failing deployments
gh workflow run disable -R your-org/agent-lab --workflow deploy.yml

# Route traffic away from affected instances
# Implementation depends on hosting platform
```

**For Data Issues:**
```bash
# Quarantine affected data files
mv data/runs.csv data/runs.csv.quarantined
mv data/sessions/ data/sessions.quarantined/

# Switch to read-only mode if possible
```

**For Security Issues:**
```bash
# Rotate compromised credentials immediately
# Block suspicious IP addresses
# Enable additional logging/monitoring
```

#### 2.2 Temporary Mitigations
- Enable maintenance mode page
- Implement circuit breakers for failing services
- Route users to cached/static content
- Provide manual workarounds for critical features

### Phase 3: Recovery (1-4 hours)

#### 3.1 Recovery Execution

**Automated Recovery:**
```bash
# Trigger rollback workflow
gh workflow run rollback.yml -R your-org/agent-lab \
  -f reason="Automated rollback due to deployment failure" \
  -f target_environment=production
```

**Manual Recovery Steps:**
1. **Code Repository Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # If GitHub is unavailable, use mirror repository
   git clone https://gitlab.com/your-org/agent-lab-mirror.git
   cd agent-lab
   git checkout last-known-good-commit
   ```

2. **Data Recovery:**
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   python scripts/restore_data.py --date $(date +%Y%m%d) --type sessions
   python scripts/restore_data.py --date $(date +%Y%m%d) --type telemetry
   ```

3. **Application Restart:**
   ```bash
   # Emergency deployment script
   ./scripts/emergency-deploy.sh
   ```

#### 3.2 Validation Checks
- [ ] Application health endpoints responding
- [ ] Core functionality working (agent creation, chat, export)
- [ ] Data integrity verified (no corrupted sessions/CSV)
- [ ] User authentication and authorization working
- [ ] Performance metrics within acceptable ranges

### Phase 4: Post-Incident Analysis (4+ hours)

#### 4.1 Root Cause Analysis
**Timeline Reconstruction:**
- Document all events with timestamps
- Identify triggering event and contributing factors
- Map incident progression and response actions

**Analysis Questions:**
- What caused the incident?
- Why wasn't it detected earlier?
- How effective was the response?
- What can prevent recurrence?

#### 4.2 Remediation Actions
- [ ] Implement permanent fixes for root cause
- [ ] Update monitoring/alerting rules
- [ ] Enhance automated testing coverage
- [ ] Update documentation and runbooks
- [ ] Schedule follow-up reviews

#### 4.3 Communication Plan
**Internal Communication:**
- Incident post-mortem meeting within 24 hours
- Action items assigned with owners and deadlines
- Updated procedures distributed to team

**External Communication:**
- User status page updates during incident
- Post-incident transparency report
- Proactive communication about improvements

## Specific Incident Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Deployment Failure

**Symptoms:** GitHub Actions deployment workflow fails, application errors in logs

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check deployment logs for error details
2. Verify test suite passes locally
3. Check for dependency conflicts or breaking changes

**Recovery:**
1. Identify failing commit via git bisect
2. Create hotfix branch with minimal changes
3. Test fix in staging environment
4. Deploy fix with rollback plan ready

### Scenario 2: Data Corruption

**Symptoms:** CSV parsing errors, session load failures, data integrity alerts

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Stop all write operations to affected data
2. Create backups of current (corrupted) state
3. Assess scope of corruption

**Recovery:**
1. Restore from last known good backup
2. Validate data integrity post-restore
3. Implement additional validation checks
4. Monitor for recurrence

### Scenario 3: Performance Degradation

**Symptoms:** Slow response times, high error rates, resource exhaustion

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Check system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
2. Review recent changes for performance regressions
3. Enable request throttling if needed

**Recovery:**
1. Scale resources if infrastructure-related
2. Rollback performance-impacting changes
3. Implement performance optimizations
4. Add performance regression tests

### Scenario 4: Security Incident

**Symptoms:** Unauthorized access attempts, unusual traffic patterns, data exposure alerts

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Rotate all credentials and API keys
3. Enable enhanced logging and monitoring
4. Notify security team and legal if needed

**Recovery:**
1. Complete security audit
2. Patch vulnerabilities
3. Restore from clean backups
4. Implement additional security measures
