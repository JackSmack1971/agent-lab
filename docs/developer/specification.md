# Repository Cleanup and Reorganization Requirements Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the requirements for a comprehensive cleanup and reorganization of the Agent Lab repository. The goal is to remove outdated artifacts, consolidate documentation, eliminate temporary files, and establish a cleaner, more maintainable file structure that aligns with industry best practices for Python projects.

## Current State Analysis
The repository contains approximately 120+ files across multiple directories. Key observations:

- **Active Code Structure**: Well-organized source code in `src/`, `agents/`, `services/`, and `tests/` directories
- **Documentation Scatter**: Numerous `.md` files scattered in root directory
- **Report Accumulation**: Multiple security and audit reports from previous phases
- **Temporary Artifacts**: Test outputs and temporary directories
- **Development Leftovers**: Pseudocode files and intermediate development artifacts

## Identified Issues

### 1. Outdated Development Artifacts
- **Pseudocode Files**: `pseudocode-conftest.md`, `pseudocode-implementation-flow.md`, `pseudocode-pytest-ini.md`, `pseudocode-readme.md`, `pseudocode-test-structure.md`, `pseudocode.md` - These appear to be from early development phases and may no longer reflect current implementation
- **Intermediate Reports**: `docs/reports/integration-report.md`, `docs/reports/qa-validation-report.md`, `state_analysis.json`, `docs/reports/state_analysis.md` - Potentially outdated analysis artifacts

### 2. Leftover Files from Previous Development Phases
- **Test Outputs**: `pytest-collect-output.txt` - Temporary test collection output
- **Approval Test Temp**: `.approval_tests_temp/` directory - Temporary testing artifacts
- **Development Notes**: `complexity-notes.md`, `TDD-chain.md` - May be superseded by current documentation

### 3. Files Not Reflecting Current Repository State
- **State Files**: `repo_state.json`, `workflow-state.json` - May contain stale state information
- **Audit Reports**: `bandit-report.json`, `pip-audit-report.json`, `safety-report.json`, `security-audit-report.json` - Need verification of currency

### 4. Organizational Opportunities
- **Documentation Consolidation**: Many `.md` files in root should be moved to `docs/` directory
- **Memory Bank**: `memory-bank/` directory contains internal documentation that could be better integrated
- **Security Documentation**: Security-related files scattered across root and could be grouped

## Reorganization Plan

### Phase 1: Documentation Consolidation
- Move all loose `.md` files from root to appropriate subdirectories under `docs/`
- Create `docs/pseudocode/` for pseudocode files (if retaining)
- Create `docs/reports/` for audit and analysis reports
- Create `docs/security/` for security-related documentation

### Phase 2: Artifact Removal
- Delete identified temporary and outdated files
- Archive rather than delete potentially useful reports (move to `docs/archive/`)

### Phase 3: Directory Restructuring
- Consolidate `memory-bank/` into `docs/internal/`
- Ensure `docs/` structure follows logical grouping:
  - `docs/user/` - User-facing documentation
  - `docs/developer/` - Developer guides
  - `docs/security/` - Security documentation
  - `docs/operations/` - Runbooks, monitoring, etc.

### Phase 4: Validation and Cleanup
- Verify no broken references after reorganization
- Update any documentation that references moved files
- Ensure CI/CD pipelines still function correctly

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- **Data Loss**: Session data in `data/sessions/` must not be touched as it contains runtime data
- **CI/CD Breakage**: GitHub workflows reference specific file paths that may change
- **Documentation Gaps**: Removing files that are still referenced in README or other docs

### Medium Risk Items
- **Code Dependencies**: Some removed files might be imported or referenced in code (though unlikely for .md files)
- **Build Process**: If any build scripts reference removed artifacts

### Low Risk Items
- **Report Removal**: Security reports can be regenerated if needed
- **Pseudocode Deletion**: These are development artifacts with low business value

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Backup First**: Create full repository backup before any deletions
- **Reference Check**: Use grep to search for references to files before removal
- **Gradual Approach**: Remove files in batches with validation between steps
- **Revert Plan**: Maintain git history for easy reversion

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope
- Reorganization of documentation and non-code artifacts
- Removal of temporary and outdated files
- Consolidation of scattered documentation
- Establishment of clear directory structure for docs

### Out of Scope
- Modification of source code structure (`src/`, `agents/`, `services/`)
- Changes to test organization (`tests/`)
- Alteration of CI/CD workflows (`.github/`)
- Modification of configuration files (unless directly related to cleanup)
- Changes to runtime data (`data/`)

### Boundaries
- No touching of application code or logic
- Maintain existing functionality and build processes
- Preserve all security and compliance configurations
- Keep all active development workflows intact

## Dependencies
- Access to full repository for analysis
- Ability to perform file operations (move, delete, create directories)
- Git access for version control and backup
- Text search tools for reference checking

## Success Criteria
- Repository structure aligns with Python project best practices
- No broken references or links
- All CI/CD pipelines continue to function
- Documentation remains accessible and well-organized
- No data loss or functionality impact
