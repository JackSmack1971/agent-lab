# Acceptance Criteria for Repository Cleanup and Reorganization

## Testable Acceptance Criteria

### AC-1: File Removal Verification
**Given** the repository contains identified outdated artifacts  
**When** the cleanup process completes  
**Then** the following files/directories are removed:
- `.approval_tests_temp/` directory
- `pytest-collect-output.txt`
- All pseudocode files: `pseudocode-conftest.md`, `pseudocode-implementation-flow.md`, `pseudocode-pytest-ini.md`, `pseudocode-readme.md`, `pseudocode-test-structure.md`, `pseudocode.md`

**Test Method**: `ls -la | grep -E "(pseudocode|\.approval_tests_temp|pytest-collect-output\.txt)" | wc -l` should return 0

### AC-2: Documentation Consolidation
**Given** scattered `.md` files in root directory  
**When** reorganization completes  
**Then** all user-facing documentation is moved to `docs/` subdirectories  
**And** directory structure follows: `docs/user/`, `docs/developer/`, `docs/security/`, `docs/operations/`

**Test Method**: `find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" | grep -v README.md | wc -l` should be ≤ 5 (essential root files only)

### AC-3: No Broken References
**Given** files are moved or removed  
**When** repository is scanned  
**Then** no references to deleted/moved files exist in remaining code or documentation

**Test Method**: `grep -r "pseudocode-" --include="*.md" --include="*.py" . | wc -l` should return 0

### AC-4: Build System Integrity
**Given** reorganization changes file locations  
**When** build process runs  
**Then** all tests pass with ≥90% coverage  
**And** application starts successfully

**Test Method**:
- `pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing` passes with exit code 0
- `python app.py` starts without import errors

### AC-5: CI/CD Pipeline Functionality
**Given** file structure changes  
**When** CI/CD workflows execute  
**Then** all GitHub Actions workflows complete successfully  
**And** no workflow failures due to missing files

**Test Method**: Push to repository triggers CI and all jobs pass (manual verification in CI logs)

### AC-6: Documentation Accessibility
**Given** documentation reorganization  
**When** docs are accessed  
**Then** all links in README.md resolve correctly  
**And** documentation structure is navigable

**Test Method**: `markdown-link-check README.md` returns no broken links

### AC-7: Data Integrity Preservation
**Given** runtime data exists in `data/` directory  
**When** cleanup completes  
**Then** no files in `data/sessions/` are modified or removed  
**And** session data remains intact

**Test Method**: `find data/sessions/ -type f | wc -l` matches pre-cleanup count

### AC-8: Security Configuration Integrity
**Given** security-related files are reorganized  
**When** security scans run  
**Then** all security configurations remain functional  
**And** no security settings are lost

**Test Method**:
- `bandit -r src/` completes without configuration errors
- Security workflows in `.github/` execute successfully

### AC-9: Git History Preservation
**Given** files are removed  
**When** git operations performed  
**Then** repository remains in clean git state  
**And** no uncommitted changes exist

**Test Method**: `git status --porcelain` returns empty output

### AC-10: Performance Impact Assessment
**Given** repository size changes  
**When** cleanup completes  
**Then** repository size is reduced by ≥20%  
**And** no performance degradation in build times

**Test Method**:
- `du -sh .` shows size reduction
- Build time benchmark shows ≤5% increase (if any)

## Quality Gates

### Pre-Cleanup Validation
- [ ] Full repository backup created
- [ ] Current test suite passes (baseline)
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines green
- [ ] All file references documented

### Post-Cleanup Validation
- [ ] All AC-1 through AC-10 pass
- [ ] Peer review of changes completed
- [ ] Rollback plan documented and tested
- [ ] Stakeholder approval obtained

## Risk Mitigation Checks

### RM-1: Revert Capability
**Test**: `git log --oneline -10` shows cleanup commits that can be reverted

### RM-2: Backup Integrity
**Test**: Backup archive exists and can be restored

### RM-3: Impact Assessment
**Test**: Compare `git diff --stat` before/after cleanup shows only expected changes

## Definition of Done
