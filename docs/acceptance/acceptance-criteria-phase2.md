# Acceptance Criteria for UX Phase 2: Core UX Enhancement

## Overview
This document defines the detailed acceptance criteria for Phase 2 UX enhancements in Agent Lab. Each feature includes specific, measurable criteria that must be met for the feature to be considered complete and ready for production deployment.

## 1. Smooth Transitions & Micro-interactions

### AC-1.1: Tab Transition Animations
**Given** a user switches between tabs in the interface
**When** the transition occurs
**Then** a smooth fade transition (300-500ms) should animate the content change
**And** no content should appear abruptly without transition
**And** the transition should respect `prefers-reduced-motion` settings

### AC-1.2: Button Interaction Feedback
**Given** a user clicks any interactive button or control
**When** the click occurs
**Then** a subtle visual feedback animation should occur (150-200ms)
**And** the button should show pressed state styling
**And** the animation should complete before any resulting action

### AC-1.3: Loading State Animations
**Given** an operation takes longer than 500ms to complete
**When** the loading state is shown
**Then** skeleton screens should animate with subtle pulsing effects
**And** progress indicators should show smooth progress animation
**And** loading states should not appear frozen or static

### AC-1.4: Success Feedback Animations
**Given** a user completes a successful action (save, send, etc.)
**When** the action completes
**Then** a brief success animation should appear (checkmark icon, 1000ms duration)
**And** the animation should be subtle and non-intrusive
**And** success feedback should be accessible to screen readers

### AC-1.5: Performance Impact Assessment

**And** large text should meet 3:1 contrast ratio
**And** interactive elements should meet 3:1 contrast in all states

### AC-3.3: Spacing Grid Implementation
**Given** all UI elements and layouts
**When** measured for spacing
**Then** margins and padding should use the 4px base grid (4, 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64px)
**And** consistent spacing should be maintained between related elements
**And** no arbitrary spacing values should be used

### AC-3.4: Component Consistency
**Given** similar UI components throughout the application
**When** compared visually
**Then** all buttons should have identical styling and behavior
**And** all form inputs should follow the same design patterns
**And** all cards and panels should use consistent shadows and borders

### AC-3.5: Responsive Design
**Given** the application viewed on different screen sizes
**When** tested at breakpoints (320px, 768px, 1024px)
**Then** layouts should adapt appropriately to each breakpoint
**And** no horizontal scrolling should be required on mobile
**And** touch targets should meet 44px minimum size

## 4. AI-Powered Parameter Optimization

### AC-4.1: Use Case Detection Accuracy
**Given** a user enters a prompt or selects a use case
