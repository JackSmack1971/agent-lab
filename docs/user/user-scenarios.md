# User Scenarios for Repository Cleanup and Reorganization

## Overview
These user scenarios describe the expected behaviors and outcomes for different stakeholders during and after the repository cleanup and reorganization process. Each scenario follows the format: **As a [user role], I want [goal] so that [benefit].**

### Scenario Steps
1. Pipeline maintainer reviews reorganization plan
2. Identifies workflow dependencies on file paths
3. Verifies all referenced files remain accessible
4. Tests pipeline execution post-cleanup
5. Monitors for any build failures

### Success Criteria
- All GitHub Actions workflows pass
- No broken file references in workflow YAML files
- Build times remain within acceptable limits

## US-3: Security Reviewer
**As a** security auditor reviewing the codebase  
**I want** all security documentation consolidated and easily accessible  
**So that** I can efficiently assess security posture

### Scenario Steps
1. Security reviewer navigates to `docs/security/`
2. Finds threat models, security architecture, and audit reports
3. Reviews docs/security/SECURITY.md and related documents
4. Accesses current security scan results
5. Verifies compliance documentation is organized

### Success Criteria

- No security files scattered in root directory
- Clear navigation between security documents

## US-4: Open Source Contributor
**As an** external contributor submitting a pull request  
**I want** the repository to be clean and well-organized  
**So that** I can focus on code changes without navigating clutter

### Scenario Steps
1. Contributor explores repository structure
2. Finds relevant documentation quickly
3. Understands contribution guidelines from organized docs
4. Submits PR without confusion from outdated files
5. Receives clear feedback on properly organized changes

### Success Criteria
- Root directory contains only essential files
- Documentation follows standard open-source project structure
- No temporary or development artifacts visible

## US-5: Project Manager
**As a** project manager overseeing development  
**I want** clear visibility into project state after cleanup  
**So that** I can assess progress and make informed decisions

### Scenario Steps
1. Project manager reviews repository structure
2. Verifies documentation is current and organized
3. Checks that all necessary artifacts are preserved
4. Assesses impact of cleanup on project timeline
5. Confirms no critical information was lost

### Success Criteria

- Clear audit trail of what was removed and why

## US-6: Quality Assurance Engineer
**As a** QA engineer validating releases  
**I want** test artifacts properly organized and accessible  
**So that** I can efficiently verify testing completeness

### Scenario Steps
1. QA engineer accesses test documentation
2. Reviews test plans and acceptance criteria
3. Checks test coverage reports
4. Validates that QA processes remain intact
5. Ensures testing infrastructure is not impacted

### Success Criteria

- No removal of active test artifacts
- Test execution remains reliable

## US-7: System Administrator
**As a** system administrator deploying the application  
**I want** deployment and operations documentation clearly organized  
**So that** I can reliably deploy and maintain the system

### Scenario Steps
1. Sysadmin navigates to `docs/operations/`
2. Finds runbooks, monitoring guides, and deployment instructions
3. Accesses emergency response procedures
4. Reviews backup and rollback strategies
5. Locates troubleshooting guides

### Success Criteria

- Clear audit trail of cleanup decisions
- No impact on regulatory compliance status

## Edge Case Scenarios

## US-9: Recovery from Failed Cleanup
**As a** developer responding to cleanup issues  
**I want** ability to quickly revert changes  
**So that** normal development can resume

### Scenario Steps
1. Issue detected post-cleanup (e.g., broken build)
2. Developer identifies cleanup as cause
3. Uses git to revert reorganization commits
4. Verifies system returns to functional state
5. Applies fixes before retrying cleanup

### Success Criteria
