# Project State (Extrapolation)

* `[Inference] Phase: GA` (confidence 0.95) — Version 1.0.0 released with comprehensive documentation, testing, CI/CD, security, observability, and operations. All major features implemented and production-ready.
* Workstreams & Status (each with evidence)
  * Agent Testing Platform: done (`docs/user/PRD.md:1-289`)
  * Cost Optimization: done (`README.md:8-12`)
  * Security Implementation: done (`docs/security/SECURITY.md:1-192`)
  * Observability: done (`docs/docs/operations/observability.md:1-276`)
* Top Risks (each with likelihood × impact + evidence)
  * R-001: Dependency Security Vulnerabilities (low × high) — Regular security scans with bandit, safety, pip-audit (`.bandit.yml:1-10`, `bandit-report.json:1-1`)
  * R-002: Production Deployment Issues (med × high) — Blue-green deployment with automatic rollback (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml:200-381`)
  * R-003: Performance Degradation (low × med) — Real-time monitoring and alerting (`docs/docs/operations/observability.md:100-150`)

# High-ROI Actions (1–3d)

* A-001 Monitor Production Health and Metrics (effort M, expected lift observability +0) — Health checks pass consistently, SLOs are met, No critical alerts — `docs/docs/operations/observability.md`
* A-002 Update Dependencies for Security Patches (effort S, expected lift security +0) — Security scans pass, No new vulnerabilities introduced — `requirements.txt`, `requirements.lock`
* A-003 Expand Test Coverage if Below 90% (effort M, expected lift tests +0) — Test coverage >= 90%, All tests pass — `tests/`
* A-004 Review and Update Documentation (effort S, expected lift docs +0) — Documentation is current and accurate — `README.md`, `docs/`
* A-005 Optimize CI/CD Pipeline Performance (effort M, expected lift ci +0) — Build times reduced, Pipeline reliability improved — `.github/workflows/`
* A-006 Enhance Error Budget Tracking (effort S, expected lift observability +0) — Error budgets properly monitored — `docs/docs/operations/observability.md`

# Coverage & Gaps

* I cannot verify actual deployment success; no production logs available.
* I cannot verify real-time performance metrics; requires running application.
