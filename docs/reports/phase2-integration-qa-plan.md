# QA Plan: UX Phase 2 Cross-Feature Integration Testing & Quality Assurance

## Overview
This QA plan outlines comprehensive integration testing for UX Phase 2 features to ensure seamless functionality and quality standards. The plan focuses on cross-feature integration, end-to-end workflows, regression prevention, and validation against Phase 2 acceptance criteria.

## Objectives
- Validate all Phase 2 features integrate seamlessly
- Ensure end-to-end user workflows function correctly
- Confirm no regressions from Phase 1 functionality
- Verify performance benchmarks are met or exceeded
- Achieve WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Validate cross-browser and mobile compatibility
- Meet user acceptance testing success rates

## Test Scope

### Integration Testing
- All Phase 2 features working together (transitions, accessibility, design system, AI optimization, model comparison)
- Component interactions across tabs (Chat, Configuration, Sessions, Analytics, Model Comparison)
- API integrations (OpenRouter, persistence, cost analysis)
- State management across features

### End-to-End Testing
- Complete user journey: Chat → Configuration (with AI optimization) → Sessions → Analytics → Model Comparison
- Accessibility workflow: Keyboard navigation through all features, screen reader compatibility
- Performance workflow: Heavy usage scenarios with multiple concurrent operations
- Mobile responsiveness: Touch interactions and responsive design validation
- Error handling: Graceful degradation and error recovery across all features

### Regression Testing
- Phase 1 features remain functional (tabbed UI, basic chat, session management)
- Existing API endpoints and data persistence
- Browser compatibility maintained
- Performance baselines not degraded

### Performance Testing
- Load times <10% degradation from Phase 1
- Memory usage within acceptable limits
- Core Web Vitals maintained
- Concurrent operation handling
- AI optimization response times (<2 seconds)

### Accessibility Testing
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
- Keyboard navigation coverage (100%)
- Screen reader compatibility (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- ARIA implementation and live regions
- Focus management and indicators
- Form accessibility and error announcements

### Cross-Browser Testing
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge support
- Layout consistency and functionality preservation
- Graceful degradation for unsupported features
- Mobile: iOS Safari and Android Chrome
