**Mitigation Measures:**
- âœ… Performance monitoring already in place
- âœ… Error tracking covers new components
- âœ… Usage analytics can track feature adoption
- âœ… User feedback mechanisms available

**Residual Risk:** Very Low - Existing monitoring covers new features

## Risk Monitoring Plan
