## Design Principles Applied

### Progressive Visual Hierarchy
- **Content Grouping**: Related elements visually grouped with subtle shadows and borders
- **Information Density**: Optimized spacing creates clear scanning paths
- **Consistent Spacing**: Uniform gaps create rhythm and improve comprehension
- **Semantic Color Usage**: Colors convey meaning and state information

### Accessibility-First Approach
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All contrast ratios and interaction patterns meet standards
- **Semantic HTML**: Proper use of headings, landmarks, and ARIA attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality accessible via keyboard
- **Screen Reader Support**: Comprehensive screen reader compatibility

### Mobile-First Responsive Design
- **Breakpoint Strategy**: Content designed for mobile, enhanced for larger screens
- **Touch Optimization**: All controls meet accessibility touch target requirements
- **Content Adaptation**: Layouts gracefully adapt to different screen sizes
- **Performance Considerations**: Optimized for battery life and network constraints

## Technical Architecture

### CSS Organization
```
