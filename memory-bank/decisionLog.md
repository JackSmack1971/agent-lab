# Decision Log

## Security Assessment Decisions

### Decision: Production Approval for Agent Lab
**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Context:** SPARC Autonomous Adversary completed comprehensive security assessment  
**Decision:** ðŸŸ¢ APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION with LOW risk rating  
**Rationale:**
- Zero critical or high-severity vulnerabilities identified
- One medium-severity issue (server binding) resolved via HANDOFF/V1
- Strong security controls implemented (input validation, secret management, access controls)
- Comprehensive risk mitigation strategies documented
- All quality gates for security passed

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Delay deployment until all recommendations implemented (rejected: unnecessary delay for low-risk items)
- Implement all recommendations immediately (rejected: not cost-effective for low-impact items)

**Impact:** Enables confident production deployment with appropriate monitoring

### Decision: Server Binding Configuration Fix
**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Context:** Bandit identified B104 (hardcoded server_name="0.0.0.0")  
**Decision:** Implement environment-configurable binding with 127.0.0.1 default  
**Rationale:**
- Eliminates exposure to all network interfaces in production
- Maintains localhost development convenience
- Follows principle of least privilege
- Backward compatible with existing deployments

**Implementation:** GRADIO_SERVER_HOST environment variable with secure default

### Decision: Web Tool Domain Allow-List
**Date:** Ongoing project decision  
**Context:** Web fetch tool security design  
**Decision:** Strict allow-list: {"example.com", "api.github.com", "raw.githubusercontent.com"}  
**Rationale:**
- Prevents unauthorized data access
- Limits tool to approved, low-risk domains
- Enables functionality while maintaining security
- Exact refusal text for testing compliance

### Decision: Mitigation Priority Framework
**Date:** 2025-10-02  
**Context:** Security assessment recommendations  
**Decision:** Three-tier priority system (1-Immediate, 2-Short-term, 3-Long-term)  
**Rationale:**
- Resource limits and monitoring most critical for production stability
- CI/CD integration important for ongoing security
- Advanced features can be implemented post-deployment
- Balances security with development velocity

**Priorities:**
- P1: Resource limits, enhanced monitoring, security logging
- P2: CI/CD security, rate limiting, secret scanning
- P3: CSP headers, advanced auditing, monitoring dashboards

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Pydantic for All Data Validation
**Date:** Ongoing  
**Context:** Data handling and validation strategy  
**Decision:** Use Pydantic BaseModel for all structured data  
**Rationale:**
- Type safety and runtime validation
- Automatic serialization/deserialization
- Comprehensive error messages
- Consistent API across the application

### Decision: Environment Variable Only for Secrets
**Date:** Ongoing  
**Context:** API key management  
**Decision:** OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable only  
**Rationale:**
- No accidental logging or file storage
- Follows 12-factor app principles
- Prevents credential leaks in code/dumps
- Clear deployment configuration requirements

## Quality Decisions

### Decision: Comprehensive Test Coverage Requirements
**Date:** Ongoing  
**Context:** Testing strategy for production readiness  
**Decision:** >90% coverage for agents/ and services/ directories  
**Rationale:**
- Critical business logic must be thoroughly tested
- Prevents regressions in core functionality
- Enables confident refactoring and enhancements
- Industry standard for production applications

### Decision: HANDOFF/V1 Protocol for Inter-Mode Communication
**Date:** Ongoing  
**Context:** Cross-specialist collaboration  
**Decision:** Formal handoff contracts with complete context  
**Rationale:**
- Ensures no information loss between modes
- Provides audit trail for decisions
- Enables autonomous operation with oversight
- Standardizes communication quality
