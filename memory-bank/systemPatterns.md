- Root object with `customModes` array
- Each mode object contains: slug, name, roleDefinition, groups (required)
- Optional fields: description, whenToUse, customInstructions
- Groups array: simple strings ("read", "edit") or tuples with restrictions
- Edit restrictions: fileRegex pattern and description
- Slug format: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$/` (lowercase, numbers, hyphens only)
**Validation Rules**:
- Valid YAML/JSON syntax required
- Slug uniqueness and format validation
- Groups structure validation (array of strings/tuples)
- File regex compilation check
- Property compatibility (description requires recent versions)
**Common Errors & Fixes**:
- YAML syntax errors: Use 2-space indentation, colons after keys
- Groups structure: Use `edit:\n  fileRegex: pattern` not nested objects
- Regex escaping: Single backslashes in YAML, double in JSON
- Property not allowed: Update Roo Code or remove unsupported fields
**Benefits**:
- Flexible mode specialization
- Security through file restrictions
- Clear role definitions
- Maintainable configuration
- Automated validation and error reporting
