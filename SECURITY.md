# Security Policy

## üîí Security Overview

Agent Lab takes security seriously. As an AI agent testing platform, we are committed to ensuring the security and privacy of our users and their data. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability disclosure process, and security considerations.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Agent Lab, please help us by reporting it responsibly.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing:
- **Email**: security@agentlab.dev (placeholder - configure actual contact)
- **Subject**: `[SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Agent Lab`

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
3. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
4. **Environment**: Your system details (OS, Python version, etc.)
5. **Proof of Concept**: If available, a proof-of-concept demonstrating the vulnerability

### Our Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the report
3. **Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress
4. **Resolution**: We will work to resolve the issue and release a fix
5. **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will coordinate disclosure with you

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- We will credit researchers who report vulnerabilities (unless anonymity is requested)
- We will not pursue legal action against researchers who follow this policy
- We reserve the right to withhold details until a fix is available

## üîç Security Considerations

### Data Handling

**What We Collect:**
- User-generated conversation data (stored locally only)
- Cost and usage metrics for optimization
- Session metadata (timestamps, model information)

**What We Don't Collect:**
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- API keys (stored locally in environment variables)
- User behavior analytics beyond basic usage metrics

### API Security

- **OpenRouter Integration**: All API calls require valid API keys
- **Rate Limiting**: Controlled through UI interaction patterns
- **Request Validation**: All inputs are validated before API transmission
- **Response Sanitization**: API responses are processed server-side

### Network Security

- **Local Binding**: Application binds to localhost by default
- **Domain Restrictions**: Web tool access limited to approved domains
- **No External Services**: All data stays on the user's local system

### Tool Security

- **Allow-Listed Tools**: Only math, time, and restricted web access tools
- **Input Validation**: All tool inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Resource Limits**: Content truncation and access restrictions

## üìã Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported | Security Updates |
|---------|-----------|------------------|
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes    | Full support     |
| < 1.0.0 | ‚ùå No     | Not supported    |

### Version Support Policy

- **Latest Version**: Always use the latest stable release
- **Security Patches**: Critical security fixes backported to recent versions
- **End of Life**: Unsupported versions may contain unpatched vulnerabilities

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Key Management**
   - Store API keys securely in environment variables
   - Never commit API keys to version control
   - Rotate keys regularly

2. **Network Security**
   - Run Agent Lab on trusted networks
   - Use firewall rules to restrict access if needed
   - Consider VPN usage for untrusted networks

3. **Data Protection**
   - Regularly backup important session data
   - Be aware that all data is stored locally
   - Use encryption for sensitive local data if required

### For Developers

1. **Code Security**
   - Follow secure coding practices
   - Use input validation for all user inputs
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use security scanning tools
   - Review dependency changes

3. **Testing**
   - Include security tests in CI/CD
   - Perform regular security audits
   - Test for common vulnerabilities

## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required: OpenRouter API key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_secure_api_key_here

# Optional: Server binding (default: 127.0.0.1)
GRADIO_SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1
```

### Docker Security

When using Docker:
- Use official base images
- Run as non-root user
- Limit container capabilities
- Keep images updated

## üìä Security Metrics

We track and monitor:

- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Weekly scans with safety/pip-audit
- **Code Security**: Static analysis with bandit
- **Test Coverage**: >90% coverage maintained
- **Incident Response**: 48-hour acknowledgment SLA

## üö´ Prohibited Activities

The following activities are strictly prohibited:

- Attempting to bypass security controls
- Using Agent Lab for illegal activities
- Attempting to access unauthorized systems
- Sharing or leaking API keys
- Modifying security controls without authorization

## üìû Contact Information

- **Security Issues**: security@agentlab.dev
- **General Support**: support@agentlab.dev
- **Documentation**: [Security Architecture](security-architecture.md)

## üìú Security Updates

Security updates and patches will be:
- Released as soon as possible after validation
- Documented in release notes
- Communicated through GitHub releases
- Coordinated with vulnerability reporters

## üîÑ Continuous Security

We maintain security through:

- **Automated Scanning**: Bandit, safety, and dependency checks
- **Code Reviews**: Security-focused review process
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic security assessments
- **Community Monitoring**: Encouraging responsible disclosure
