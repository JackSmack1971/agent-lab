# Cost Optimizer Feature Specification

## Overview
The Cost Optimizer feature provides real-time cost monitoring, alerting, and actionable optimization suggestions for AI agent usage in Agent Lab. It builds on the existing telemetry system to help users manage and reduce their AI API costs effectively.

## Architecture Integration
The Cost Optimizer follows Agent Lab's 3-layer architecture:
- **UI Layer**: Real-time cost display and optimization suggestions in Gradio interface
- **Runtime Layer**: Cost analysis service with business logic
- **API Layer**: Integration with existing telemetry persistence and model catalog

## Core Components

### 1. Data Models (`src/models/cost_analysis.py`)
Pydantic models for cost analysis data structures:

#### CostAlert
- `alert_type`: Enum (high_cost, budget_warning, optimization_opportunity)
- `message`: str - Human-readable alert description
- `severity`: Enum (low, medium, high)
- `estimated_savings`: float - Potential cost savings in dollars

#### OptimizationSuggestion
- `suggestion_type`: Enum (switch_model, reduce_context, enable_caching)
- `description`: str - Detailed suggestion explanation
- `estimated_savings_percentage`: float - Percentage cost reduction
- `estimated_savings_dollars`: float - Absolute dollar savings
- `confidence_score`: float (0.0-1.0) - AI confidence in suggestion

#### CostAnalysis
- `current_cost`: float - Session running total
- `average_cost`: float - User's historical average per conversation
- `cost_trend`: Enum (increasing, decreasing, stable)
- `alerts`: List[CostAlert] - Active alerts for current session
- `suggestions`: List[OptimizationSuggestion] - Applicable optimizations

### 2. Cost Analysis Service (`src/services/cost_analysis_service.py`)
Business logic service for cost calculations and optimization suggestions:

#### analyze_costs(session_id: str) -> CostAnalysis
- Calculate running total for current session from telemetry data
- Compare to user's average cost per conversation (from historical data)
- Detect anomalies (cost > 5x average = high alert)
- Generate optimization suggestions based on:
  - Context length analysis (>20k tokens + cost >$1 → suggest summarization)
  - Model efficiency analysis (GPT-4 cost >$0.10 with <10% quality gap vs GPT-3.5 → suggest switch)
  - Pattern detection (repeated queries → suggest caching)
- Calculate estimated savings for each suggestion using historical data

#### get_cost_trends(user_id: str, timeframe: str) -> dict
- Aggregate costs over time periods (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Calculate forecasts using moving averages
- Return trend data for visualization

#### Real-time Integration
- Hook into existing `send_message_streaming` function in `app.py`
- Update cost analysis after each message completion
- Maintain session-based cost accumulation

### 3. UI Component (`src/components/cost_optimizer.py`)
Gradio-based UI components for cost monitoring and optimization:

#### Real-time Cost Display
- Live updating cost counter during conversations
- Session total and per-message breakdown
- Integration with existing chat interface

#### Alert Panel
- Non-intrusive notification system for cost alerts
- Severity-based styling (color coding)
- Dismissible alerts with persistence across session

#### Optimization Suggestions Panel
- One-click "Apply" buttons for each suggestion type:
  - "Summarize earlier messages" - Triggers context summarization with preview
  - "Switch to [model]" - Updates agent configuration automatically
  - "Enable context windowing" - Configures context management settings
- Estimated savings display for each suggestion
- Confidence score visualization

#### Cost Trends Visualization
- Line chart showing last 7 days of costs
- Interactive chart with hover details
- Time period selection (daily/weekly/monthly)

#### Budget Management
- User-configurable budget setting
- Progress bar showing budget utilization
- Budget alert thresholds

#### Cost Breakdown
- Cost by model type
- Cost by feature usage
- Detailed breakdown table

### 4. Integration Points

#### Main Application (`src/main.py`)
- Add "Cost Optimizer" tab to main interface
- Integrate cost optimizer component into existing UI layout
- Update tab navigation to include cost monitoring

#### App Integration (`app.py`)
- Hook cost analysis calls into `send_message_streaming` function
- Display alerts in main chat interface (non-intrusive notifications)
- Update real-time cost display during message streaming
- Add cost optimizer panel to sidebar or as separate tab

#### Telemetry Integration (`services/persist.py`)
- Extend existing RunRecord if needed for additional cost metadata
- Ensure cost data is properly persisted and retrievable
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing telemetry schema

## Cost Calculation Logic

### Base Cost Tracking
- Uses existing `cost_usd` field from RunRecord
- Accumulates costs per session using session_id
- Real-time updates after each message completion

### Anomaly Detection
- High cost alert: Current cost > 5x user's average conversation cost
- Budget warning: Session cost > 80% of user-defined budget
- Optimization opportunity: Detects inefficient patterns

### Optimization Suggestions
1. **Context Summarization**
   - Trigger: Cost > $1 AND context length > 20k tokens
   - Action: Summarize conversation history to reduce context
   - Savings: Estimated 30-50% reduction in per-token costs

2. **Model Switching**
   - Trigger: GPT-4 usage with cost > $0.10 per message
   - Analysis: Compare quality metrics vs GPT-3.5 performance
   - Action: Suggest switch if quality gap < 10%
   - Savings: 70-90% cost reduction for qualifying cases

3. **Context Caching**
   - Trigger: Detected repeated query patterns
   - Action: Enable semantic caching for similar queries
   - Savings: 20-40% reduction for repetitive conversations

## Security & Privacy
- No sensitive data exposure in cost analysis
- Cost data treated as telemetry (existing security model)
- User budget settings stored securely
- No external API calls for cost optimization logic

## Performance Requirements
- Cost analysis must complete < 100ms to avoid blocking UI
- Real-time updates should not impact chat streaming performance
- Historical trend calculations cached for UI responsiveness
- Memory usage bounded for long-running sessions

## Dependencies
- Extends existing telemetry system (no new external dependencies)
- Uses existing pydantic, gradio, and pandas (if needed for trends)
- Compatible with current Python 3.11+ and dependency constraints
