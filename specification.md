## Testing Techniques and Patterns

### Chain-of-Thought + Self-Polish Iteration (agents/runtime.py)
1. **Analysis Phase**: Identify untested code paths and edge cases
2. **Test Design**: Write comprehensive test cases covering all branches
3. **Iteration**: Run coverage analysis, identify gaps, add missing tests
4. **Polish**: Refactor tests for clarity, maintainability, and performance
5. **Validation**: Ensure all tests pass and coverage meets targets

### Property-Based Testing with Hypothesis (agents/models.py)
1. **Strategy Definition**: Define hypothesis strategies for model inputs
2. **Invariant Testing**: Test properties that should always hold
3. **Edge Case Generation**: Use hypothesis to find boundary conditions
4. **Shrinkage Analysis**: Minimize failing test cases for debugging
5. **Integration**: Combine with example-based tests for comprehensive coverage

### Systematic Coverage Approach (src/ modules)
1. **Module Analysis**: Map all functions, classes, and code paths
2. **Test Matrix Creation**: Define test cases for each coverage area
3. **Incremental Implementation**: Add tests systematically by component
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure component interactions are tested
5. **Performance Validation**: Verify tests run within time constraints

## Quality Standards

### Test Quality Requirements
- **Readability**: Tests must be self-documenting with clear names and assertions
- **Isolation**: Tests must not depend on external state or each other
- **Speed**: Individual tests must complete in <1 second
- **Reliability**: Zero flaky tests, deterministic behavior
- **Coverage**: Branch and line coverage, not just statement coverage

### Code Quality Maintenance
- No test code in production modules
- Proper test organization (unit/, integration/, e2e/)
- Appropriate use of fixtures and parametrization
- Clear test documentation and comments

## Validation and Verification

### Coverage Measurement
- Use pytest-cov for accurate coverage reporting
- Include branch coverage analysis
- Exclude test code from coverage calculations
- Generate HTML coverage reports for review

### Test Suite Validation
- All tests pass in CI environment
- No regressions in existing functionality
- Performance benchmarks met (execution time <60s)
- Memory usage within acceptable limits

### Flakiness Prevention
- Use pytest-randomly for test order randomization
- Implement proper async test handling
- Avoid timing-dependent tests
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Deliverables
