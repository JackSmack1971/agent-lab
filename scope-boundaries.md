- **Deployment scripts**: Any deployment or infrastructure code
- **Environment configuration**: .env files, environment variable handling

### External Dependencies
- **Third-party libraries**: pytest, gradio, pydantic-ai, etc.
- **System dependencies**: OS-level utilities and dependencies
- **Network services**: External APIs not directly owned by the application

### Documentation and Assets
- **README.md and documentation**: User and developer documentation
- **Static assets**: Images, CSS, JavaScript assets
- **Configuration files**: Non-test configuration files

### Legacy or Deprecated Code
- **Commented-out code**: Any code blocks marked as deprecated
- **Test utilities**: Helper scripts not part of the main application
- **Example code**: Code in `__main__` blocks or examples

## Testing Boundaries and Constraints

### Coverage Measurement Boundaries
- **Source directories**: Only `agents/`, `services/`, `src/` directories
- **File types**: Only `.py` files with executable code
- **Coverage scope**: Line and branch coverage only
- **Exclusion rules**: Follow existing `pyproject.toml` exclusions

### Test Type Boundaries
- **Unit tests**: Function and class level testing
- **Integration tests**: Component interaction testing
- **End-to-end tests**: UI workflow testing (existing only)
- **Performance tests**: Execution time validation only

### Quality Boundaries
- **Test frameworks**: pytest with specified plugins only
- **Mocking libraries**: Standard pytest mocking, no external mock libraries
- **Assertion styles**: Standard pytest assertions
- **Test organization**: Follow existing `tests/` directory structure

### Time and Resource Boundaries
- **Execution time**: Maximum 60 seconds for full test suite
- **Test count**: No upper limit, but performance must be maintained
- **Resource usage**: Memory and CPU usage within reasonable limits
- **CI constraints**: Must pass in GitHub Actions environment

## Functional Boundaries

### Feature Scope Boundaries
- **Core functionality**: Agent execution, model management, UI components
- **Business logic**: Cost analysis, recommendations, parameter optimization
- **Data processing**: Model validation, serialization, transformation
- **User interactions**: Component interactions, state management

### Integration Boundaries
- **Internal APIs**: Between components within the application
- **Data flow**: From UI to services to models
- **State management**: Component state and application state
- **Error handling**: Error propagation and user feedback

### Platform Boundaries
- **Operating systems**: Windows (primary), Linux/MacOS (compatibility)
- **Python versions**: 3.11+ as specified in pyproject.toml
- **Dependencies**: Versions specified in requirements.txt/lock
- **Browser compatibility**: For UI components (existing constraints)

## Testing Technique Boundaries

### agents/runtime.py (Chain-of-Thought + Self-Polish)
- **Technique scope**: Manual test design with iterative improvement
- **Coverage focus**: All execution paths and error conditions
- **Test patterns**: Unit tests with comprehensive mocking
- **Boundaries**: No integration or e2e testing for this module

### agents/models.py (Property-Based Testing)
- **Technique scope**: Hypothesis-based property testing
- **Coverage focus**: Model validation and serialization
- **Test patterns**: Generated test cases with invariants
- **Boundaries**: No manual example-based testing beyond property tests

### src/ Modules (Systematic Coverage)
- **Technique scope**: Traditional unit and integration testing
- **Coverage focus**: Component logic and service interactions
- **Test patterns**: Standard pytest patterns with fixtures
- **Boundaries**: No performance or load testing

## Risk and Assumption Boundaries

### Technical Assumptions
- **Code stability**: Target modules will not undergo major refactoring during sprint
- **Dependency stability**: Third-party libraries remain compatible
- **Test environment**: CI environment matches development environment
- **Coverage tools**: pytest-cov and coverage.py work as expected

### Resource Assumptions
- **Time availability**: 5 weeks for complete implementation
- **Team capacity**: Sufficient developer resources for testing tasks
- **Tool access**: All required testing tools are available and functional
- **Knowledge level**: Team has required testing and Python expertise

### Scope Change Boundaries
- **No scope expansion**: Additional modules cannot be added to targets
- **No technique changes**: Specified techniques must be used
- **No requirement changes**: Coverage targets and success criteria fixed
- **Change control**: Any boundary changes require explicit approval

## Validation Boundaries

### Success Criteria Boundaries
- **Coverage metrics**: Strictly â‰¥90% for all targeted modules
- **Test quality**: Must meet established quality standards
- **Performance**: Must meet execution time requirements
- **Reliability**: Zero flaky tests, 100% pass rate

### Verification Boundaries
- **Automated validation**: Coverage and test execution scripts
- **Manual validation**: Code review and spot checking
- **Regression testing**: Existing functionality must not break
- **Acceptance testing**: All AC-* criteria must pass

## Boundary Enforcement

### Monitoring and Control
- **Progress tracking**: Weekly coverage and progress reports
- **Boundary checking**: Regular reviews against defined boundaries
- **Change management**: Formal process for boundary adjustments
- **Escalation**: Clear process for boundary violation resolution

### Quality Gates
- **Entry criteria**: All prerequisites met before starting work
- **Progress gates**: Coverage milestones at end of each week
- **Exit criteria**: All success criteria met and validated
- **Acceptance gates**: Formal sign-off by stakeholders

## Boundary Violation Handling

### Detection and Response
- **Early detection**: Regular boundary compliance checks
- **Impact assessment**: Evaluate impact of potential violations
- **Mitigation planning**: Develop plans to address violations
- **Escalation process**: Clear escalation path for serious violations

### Change Control Process
1. **Change request**: Document proposed boundary change
2. **Impact analysis**: Assess impact on timeline, resources, quality
3. **Approval process**: Obtain stakeholder approval for changes
4. **Implementation**: Update documentation and communicate changes
5. **Validation**: Ensure changes don't compromise project success

## Boundary Documentation

### Version Control
- **Document versioning**: Track changes to scope and boundaries
- **Change history**: Maintain audit trail of boundary changes
- **Communication**: Ensure all team members are informed of changes
- **Archive**: Preserve historical boundaries for reference

### Communication Plan
- **Initial communication**: Share boundaries at project kickoff
- **Regular updates**: Weekly boundary compliance status
- **Change notifications**: Immediate communication of boundary changes
- **Stakeholder engagement**: Regular check-ins with project stakeholders

This scope and boundary definition ensures that Phase 2 Coverage Sprint remains focused, achievable, and aligned with project objectives while providing clear guidance for the testing team.
