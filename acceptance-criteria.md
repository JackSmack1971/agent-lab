# Cost Optimizer Acceptance Criteria

## Functional Requirements

### Cost Analysis Service
- [ ] `analyze_costs(session_id)` returns CostAnalysis with accurate current_cost calculation from telemetry data
- [ ] `analyze_costs(session_id)` correctly identifies cost anomalies (>5x average triggers high alert)
- [ ] `analyze_costs(session_id)` generates appropriate optimization suggestions based on usage patterns
- [ ] `analyze_costs(session_id)` calculates estimated savings with reasonable accuracy (Â±20%)
- [ ] `get_cost_trends(user_id, timeframe)` returns properly aggregated cost data for daily/weekly/monthly periods
- [ ] `get_cost_trends(user_id, timeframe)` includes forecast calculations using moving averages
- [ ] Service integrates with existing telemetry system without breaking current functionality
- [ ] Real-time cost updates occur after each message completion without blocking UI

### UI Components
- [ ] Real-time cost display updates during conversation streaming
- [ ] Alert panel appears automatically when cost thresholds are exceeded
- [ ] Alert panel shows appropriate severity styling (red=high, yellow=medium, blue=low)
- [ ] Optimization suggestions display with one-click "Apply" buttons
- [ ] "Summarize earlier messages" button triggers context summarization with preview
- [ ] "Switch to [model]" button updates agent configuration automatically
- [ ] "Enable context windowing" button configures context management settings
- [ ] Cost trends chart displays last 7 days of data with interactive hover details
- [ ] Budget setting interface allows user configuration with progress bar
- [ ] Cost breakdown shows accurate cost-by-model and cost-by-feature data
- [ ] All UI components integrate seamlessly with existing Gradio interface

### Data Models
- [ ] CostAlert model validates correctly with all required fields
- [ ] OptimizationSuggestion model includes confidence scoring and savings estimates
- [ ] CostAnalysis model aggregates alerts and suggestions properly
- [ ] All models use proper pydantic validation and type hints
- [ ] Models integrate with existing telemetry schema without conflicts

### Integration Points
- [ ] Cost optimizer tab added to main interface navigation
- [ ] Alerts display in chat interface as non-intrusive notifications
- [ ] Real-time cost updates integrated into message streaming flow
- [ ] Telemetry persistence extended if needed for additional cost metadata
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained with existing telemetry data

## Performance Requirements
- [ ] Cost analysis completes in <100ms for typical session sizes
- [ ] UI updates do not impact chat streaming performance (>10 tokens/second)
- [ ] Memory usage remains bounded for sessions with >100 messages
- [ ] Historical trend calculations cache appropriately for responsive UI
- [ ] No external API calls block user interactions

## Quality Requirements
- [ ] All functions include Google-style docstrings
- [ ] Type hints used for all function parameters and return values
- [ ] Code follows PEP 8 standards with black formatting
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced (checked with bandit)
- [ ] Maintainability: code is understandable and modifiable
- [ ] Testability: all functionality has corresponding test coverage

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Unit tests for all cost calculation functions with >90% coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for alert triggering logic across various cost scenarios
- [ ] Unit tests for suggestion generation with different conversation patterns
- [ ] Integration tests for telemetry system compatibility
- [ ] UI tests for "Apply" button functionality for each suggestion type
- [ ] Edge case testing (zero cost, negative values, missing data)
- [ ] Performance tests for cost analysis timing requirements
- [ ] All tests pass with pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

## Security & Privacy
- [ ] No sensitive data exposed in cost analysis or UI
- [ ] Cost data handled according to existing telemetry security model
- [ ] User budget settings stored securely
- [ ] No new external API dependencies that could leak data
- [ ] Input validation prevents injection attacks in cost calculations

## Compatibility Requirements
- [ ] Compatible with Python 3.11+ and existing dependencies
- [ ] Works with existing Gradio v5 interface patterns
- [ ] Integrates with current telemetry CSV schema
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing Agent Lab functionality
- [ ] Maintains existing session persistence and loading behavior

## User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Cost display is intuitive and doesn't clutter the interface
- [ ] Alerts are informative but not disruptive to conversation flow
- [ ] Optimization suggestions are actionable and clearly explained
- [ ] Budget management is simple to configure and understand
- [ ] Cost trends visualization is easy to interpret
- [ ] All interactions provide immediate feedback

## Business Logic Validation
- [ ] Context summarization suggested when cost > $1 AND context > 20k tokens
- [ ] Model switching suggested for GPT-4 usage > $0.10 with quality analysis
- [ ] Caching suggested when repeated query patterns detected
- [ ] High cost alerts trigger at 5x average conversation cost
- [ ] Budget warnings trigger at 80% of configured budget
- [ ] Savings estimates based on historical data patterns

## Documentation Requirements
- [ ] All code includes comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] README updated with cost optimizer feature description
- [ ] User guide includes cost monitoring and optimization instructions
- [ ] API documentation for new service functions
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide for cost-related issues

## Deployment Requirements
- [ ] Feature can be deployed independently without breaking existing functionality
- [ ] Database migrations handled gracefully if schema changes required
- [ ] Configuration options for cost thresholds and alert settings
- [ ] Logging integrated with existing application logging
- [ ] Monitoring alerts for cost optimizer service health

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Cost analysis accuracy >95% compared to manual calculations
- [ ] UI response time <500ms for all interactions
- [ ] Test coverage maintained at >90% across all new code
- [ ] Zero security vulnerabilities in cost optimizer code
- [ ] User adoption rate >70% of active Agent Lab users within 30 days
- [ ] Average cost reduction >15% for users engaging with suggestions
